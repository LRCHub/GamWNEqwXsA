Try a run, try a hide
Escape your only truth, for a while
Live the past, create a picture, it won't last
A million colours to a lie, it won't last
(x2)
When the sun is cold and black
When you wanna scream and shout
And the record plays the dark side of the moon
Brighter days, on a distant shore
You realized it's steep, to the top
Never fight, a never win reality
A million colours to a lie, that will fade
(x2)
When the sun is cold and black
When you wanna scream and shout
And the record plays the dark side of the moon
(x4)
So good. let me lose myself.
(x3)
When the sun is cold and black
When you wanna scream and shout
And the record plays the darkside of the moon
