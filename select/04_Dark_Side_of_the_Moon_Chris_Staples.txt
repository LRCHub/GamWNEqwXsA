I want to tell you a story
The only way that I can
I'm just replacing a man that came before me
One day the world is going to see
Another man replacing me
That's just the way it's got to be
It's always been that way
On the dark side of the moon
On the dark side of the moon
I want to love you
I want to pass it on
I want to give and give until it's all gone
I want to know you
While we have the time
Because that's all I got to leave behind
I want to love you
I want to pass it on
I want to give and give until it's all gone
I want to know you
While we have the time
Because that's all we got to leave behind
On the dark side of the moon
On the dark side of the moon
And when you stumble
You look the other way
And when you're riding high
Oh Lord, when you're riding high
They don't expect you to stay
I want to love you
I want to pass it on
I want to give and give until it's all gone
I want to know you
While we have the time
Because that's all I got to leave behind
I want to love you
I want to pass it on
I want to give and give until it's all gone
I want to know you
While we have the time
Because that's all we got to leave behind
On the dark side of the moon
On the dark side of the moon
