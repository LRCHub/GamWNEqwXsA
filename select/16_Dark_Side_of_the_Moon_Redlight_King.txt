I've been to the dark side of the moon.
I've been to the wrong side of the track.
Where the night goes on forever.
Fills like it wont be coming back.
Where the right side of the sun is no where to be found.
And there is no one left behind you and the silent shakes the ground.
And all you see is black... Get the hell out of here.
And dont be comeing back.
On the dark side of the moon.
The point of no return.
A place you won't remember where all you got is hurt.
On the south side of the moon.
When theres nothing in your eye.
It whill all be over soon.
When words fall apart.
On the dark side of the moon.
On the dark side of the moon.
I've been to the dark side of the moon.
I've been to a place where fortune's fly.
When everything you got is taken from you.
Hell they dont give you a reason why.
Now you are starving for forgivness.
And youve seen the angels cry.
And the nightmare creeps behind you.
Utill they'r looking you in the eyes.
And you see is black.
Get the hell out of here, and dont be coming back.
On the dark side of the moon.
The point of no return.
A place you won't remember.
Where you've got is hurt.
On the sauth side of the moon.
When there is nothuing in your heart.
It whill all be over soon.
When just fall apart.
On the dark side of the moon.
The dark side of the moon.
It's all breaking down.
Lost in the days of the world we left behind.
It's all over now, trying to save enything you have inside.
On the dark side of the moon .
The point of no return.
A place you wont remember .
Where all youve got is hurt.
On the south side of the moon.
When there's nothing in your heart.
It whill all be over soon.
When words Have fallen apart.
On the dark side of the moon.
On the dark side of the moon.
To the dark side of the moon.
On the dark side of the moon.
